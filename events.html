          <h1><font face="forte"> Bag distribution drive</p></font></h1>
          <p>A campaign which was initiated by us in the year 2015, to reduce as well as condemn the use of plastic bags as well as provide an alternative solution for it at the same time .We at TOE provide the common people with FREE CLOTH which we specially get manufactured so that the quality as well as the biodegradability of th bags are kept in check.
          <br>We started this campaign from distributing these bags on weekends on shopping centers of Delhi like Janpath, Lajpat Nagar Central Market, Palika Bazaar, Laxmi Nagar Market, Indirapuri Market etc.
          <br>In this year itself, i.e. in the year 2019, we witnessed a 95% reduction in the use of plastic bags in the Janpath market itself. We at TOE have conducted more than 50 drives till date and we hope to get the same responses from the other locations as we got from Janpath.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> Cleanup drive</p></font></h1>
          <p>Until and unless, we come forward to take the situation into our hands nothing can be done. Therefore in order to cleanse our surroundings, we at TOE came forward in the year 2015 to clean up drive the Shanti Van.<br>
          Though this event got a little left behind during the initial days ,but we have again assembled and in collaboration with many organizations such as ThereIsNoEarthB and many other , we have started to perform regular cleanup drives in the Central Park @ Rajiv Chowk metro station as well as at many different locations inside Delhi as well as in out station locations.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> #fromthisyear- Pledge Taking Campaign</p></font></h1>
          <p>This particular event is one, where we take nothing but a promise from the people , a promise that they will make this earth a better place to live. During this event we showcase a number of pledge cards, for example, “I WILL PREFER PUBLIC TRANSPORT OVER PRIVATE VEHICLE!” and many more and ask the people to take the pledge and promise us the same.<br>
          Most of the times we tend to conduct this event along with the bag distribution drive and giveaway the bags in return of taking a pledge for the sake of the environment and for our mother earth.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h1><font face="forte">Swith to metal campaign </p></font></h1>
          <p>This particular campaign was initiated in 2015. Under this campaign we motivated the school students as well as the as many people as we could to switch from plastic to metal. We were more specific about the school going students , that being the reason we visited a lot of schools so as to  pursue the students and tell then the ways to in which they can switch to metal, example being using metal pens instead of plastic pens , using metal tiffin boxes as well as metal water bottles instead of the plastic ones. We believe that this campaign has and will have a huge as well as direct impact on our environment.

        <div>
          <h1><font face="forte">Nukkad Nataks & Stage Plays</p></font></h1>
          <p>Nukkad nataks has been a renowned activity of our organization. We have performed innumerous nukkads as well as stage plays in order to aware the people about the current scenarios of the environment and what are they supposed to do.<br>
          We have performed street plays in places like  Connaught Place, Great India Place, Pari Chowk, Chanderi (Madhya Pradesh), Kasol (Himachal Pradesh) , Bennett University and many others;<br>
          We have performed stage plays in places like Lotus Temple, Pragati Maidan-ITPO World Book Fair, Krishna Engineering College, H.R.Group of Institutions and many other platforms.<br>
          In our plays , we include sloganeering as well as poem chanting so as to attract as much crowd as we can , and provide them with great entertainment as well as dozing them with the information that they should have known already but they don’t.
          </p>

        </div><div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> Plantation drives</p></font></h1>
          <p>“STOP DEFORESTATION!!””GO GREEN! “And many such slogans are used in strikes, rallies and gatherings in order to save the trees, but if we don’t plant the trees on our own, and expect the other people to do it will get us nowhere.<br>
          Tears of The Earth organization started to plant trees wherever we could from the year 2010. We have carried out various plantation drives since then, in which we motivate people to plant more and more trees and not only just to plant them but to take care of them and prevent the other trees from getting cut.<br>
          Till date, we have planted more 5000 trees nearby our locale areas. We believe that we cannot force anyone but can just request them to do something for our future generations.
          </p>

          <h1><font face="forte"> Market Awareness Drive (M.A.D.)</p></font></h1>
          <p>Market is the actual place where the major part of pollution takes place outside of our homes. We at TOE started conducting Market awareness drives since the year 2014. Under this , we conduct various market surveys , surveys on the demand of poly bags, demand of plastic packaged materials and artifacts.<br> 
          Using the data that we collected, we then take the respective actions such as our bag distribution drives, nukkad nataks, as well as general mass awareness camps.

        </div><div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> Rallies & Strikes</p></font></h1>
          <p>Our organization readily takes part in most of the rallies as well as strikes which are organized by other organizations , keeping in mind that those are just for the actual cause that is environment and not for any particular organization’s or any individual’s benefit.<br>
          Recently we took part in the Climate Strikes on Fridays, organized by Friday for Future and many other organizations and movements. <br>
          We also came forward to strike against the cutting of the Aarey Forests. We protested in front of the new Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi. <br>
          Our volunteers make posters and other hand held artifacts solely out of waste and re-used stationery , as well as we compose songs, poems , slogans as well as many other crow gathering and mass awareness activities.
          </p>

          <h1><font face="forte"> Health cum Eye Checkup Camp</p></font></h1>
          <p>Tears of The Earth organization in collaboration with J.K.Foundation , has conducted many free health checkup as well as free eye checkup camps for the people. In these camps we not only do provide free health services but also if needed provide basic medicines as well as free spectacles in case of the eye checkup camp.<br>
          At TOE we do believe in the fact that the youth is the key to a better future, but we also cannot deny the fact that the youth has a lot to learn from our experienced elders. We believe that they play an equally important role in our mission of a better environment and a better mother earth.
          </p>

        </div><div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> Blood Donation Camp</p></font></h1>
          <p>Again another event that we usually organize in collaboration with the J.K.Foundation as well as have organized some on our own. We have till date organized more than 10 successful blood camps with an average of 25 units of blood per camp.<br> 
          Every single literate being is aware of the fact that a single blood donor saves a life of 5 people, but the same literate being is scared to donate it. This is where we step into play, we are trying to break the taboo that blood donation has been in the past few years. We make people understand that it is a perfectly normal thing to do and any healthy person can do it, and that it does not puts the donating person in any kinds of weakness or disease.
          </p>

        </div><div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> Orphanage & Old Age Home Visits</p></font></h1>
          <p>The members of TOE pay regular visits to numerous orphanages as well as old age homes, reason behind , in our mission we want no one to be left behind, not the children not even the elderly people of our society.<br> 
          We recently visited the Arya Orphanage and old age home. We believe that it is not suffice for us to just pay a visit and donate some amount of money or clothes or food , but we believe that we can also educate them , entertain them as well as provide them the care as well the feeling of being loved by performing nukkad nataks for them, by organizing activities for them, by singing songs for them etc.

          </p>

        </div><div>
          <h1><font face="forte"> Village Awareness Program</p></font></h1>
          <p>Villagers, the people of rural areas or as our society so calls them the “backward“ people , but we at TOE love to address them as the “Root People” , as they are the roots from where we come from .<br>
          Tears of the Earth organization organizes this event twice a year , once during the summers and once during the winters. In this event , we visit a nearby village to Delhi , and stay there for a couple of days. In these days , we conduct multiple surveys on how much the people over there are aware about all the environment related statistics and news, nukkad nataks, to aware the masses in their own language to indulge them better, in the night time, we conduct a small gathering where we arrange visual presentations of topics like rain water harvesting , solar energy, eco-farming etc.<br>
          From VAP not only do we make people aware about the things that we are aware of, but we too get to know something new every time we visit a new village.<br>
          Recently Team TOE visited the Gelhata Village in Baraut District.

          </p>

          <h1><font face="forte"> Out-Station Events</p></font></h1>
          <p>At TOE we have got many opportunities to serve the society even out of Delhi.<br>
          We visited Kasol (Himachal Pradesh) in January 2019, and conducted various events over there like Bag Distribution Drive, Nukkad Nataks, Cleanup Drives etc.<br> 
          After Kasol we were lucky enough to be invited by the Madhya Pradesh Govt. to serve the people of Chanderi, a town near Bhopal. We did a lot of Nukkad Nataks over there, performed Bag Distribution Drives, cleanup drives, EAP etc.<br>
          Soon after we wrapped up Chanderi, we got the same invite from Raghogarh, yet another small town near Ashoknagar M.P.
